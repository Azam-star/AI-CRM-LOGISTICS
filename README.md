## 🧩 What is FreightDesk?
 
Freight brokerage runs on manual phone calls, scattered WhatsApp quotes, and spreadsheets tracking vendor rates. **FreightDesk** automates the entire pipeline: AI-assisted requirement intake, weighted vendor matching, AI-driven quote collection over voice and Tamil WhatsApp, margin-aware pricing, vendor lock-in, trip execution, and billing — with a full audit trail throughout.

## ✨ Key Features
 
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **AI Requirement Intake** | Captures freight requirements and tracks them through pricing and trip lifecycle |
| 🎯 **Vendor Matching** | Scores vendors on route, service type, lane coverage, compliance and commercial fit |
| 📋 **Weighted Shortlisting** | Surfaces the most relevant vendors before outreach begins |
| 🗣️ **Voice & WhatsApp Quoting** | AI-driven quote ingestion with confidence scoring and anomaly flags, including Tamil |
| 💰 **Margin-Aware Pricing** | Sales pricing with customer confirmation before booking |
| ✅ **L1 Rate Validation** | Vendor acceptance flow feeding automated trip creation |
| 🚚 **End-to-End Trip Execution** | Dispatch → proof of delivery → invoice → receipt → vendor payout |
| 🎭 **Simulation Mode** | Realistic operational signals so the repo demos without live telephony |
| 🧪 **Testable Domain Logic** | Matching, parsing, aggregation and rate-card checks are unit tested |

## 🚀 Quick Start
 
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start            # API + client on http://localhost:4000
```
 
For development with hot reload:
 
```bash
npm run dev           # API on 4000, Vite on 5173
```
 
First boot creates `data/freightdesk.db` (SQLite) and seeds it with sample vendors, customers, rate card rows, and six requirements across every lifecycle stage.
 
> 💾 **Data survives restarts** — the working set is snapshotted to SQLite after every write and reloaded on boot. Delete `data/` to reset to the seed.

## 🔐 Accounts
 
| Email | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin@freightdesk.local` | `admin123` | Administrator |
| `sales@freightdesk.local` | `sales123` | Sales |
| `ops@freightdesk.local` | `ops123` | Operations |
| `finance@freightdesk.local` | `finance123` | Finance |
 
Sessions are HttpOnly cookies with a configurable lifetime. Administrators can create users, reset passwords, deactivate accounts, and read the audit trail on the **Users and audit** screen.
 
> ⚠️ Change the seed passwords before deploying this anywhere shared.

## ⚙️ How the Pieces Work
 
### 🎯 Matching
 
Hard filters on fifteen vendor attributes, then a weighted score:
 
| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Availability | 30% |
| Reliability | 30% |
| Price | 25% |
| Response | 15% |
 
Excluded vendors carry their exclusion reasons.
 
### 📨 Outreach
 
Each shortlisted vendor gets an attempt on their preferred channel. In **simulation mode** (default), replies arrive on timers; in **live mode**, the message is actually sent and the reply arrives via webhook. Either way, the reply text goes through the same rules parser:
 
```text
"38500 podhum, toll extra"   →  parsed rate + confidence score
"ithu 41k"                   →  parsed rate + confidence score
"Rs. 39,500"                 →  parsed rate + confidence score
Tamil numerals               →  parsed rate + confidence score
```
 
Replies under **0.80 confidence** or more than **30% off** the rate card reference are flagged and need sales-agent verification before reaching L1.
 
### 💵 Pricing
 
L1, L2, average, and spread are computed over the usable quotes; customer price is L1 plus the agent's margin.
 
> **Worked example** (matches the design doc exactly): L1 = ₹37,800 · Average = ₹39,760 · Spread = ₹4,200 · Customer price = ₹40,824 at 8% margin
 
### 🔒 Lock-in to Payment
 
Top three vendors are offered the job → first acceptance wins (with vehicle and driver details) → the trip moves through **seven statuses** to paid → invoice raised at billing per the customer's credit terms → vendor payout tracked separately.
 
### 📝 Audit
 
Every sign-in, outreach run, verification, price, order, trip change, payment, and user-management action is recorded with the acting user and visible to administrators.

## 🌐 Going Live with Real Channels
 
Outreach stays in simulation mode until credentials are present (see `.env.example`):
 
**WhatsApp**
 
```env
WHATSAPP_TOKEN=...
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=...
```
 
Outbound messages go to the Graph API. Inbound replies must be forwarded to `POST /api/webhooks/whatsapp` with the `x-webhook-token` header set to `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (the GET handshake on the same path answers Meta's verify challenge).
 
**Voice**
 
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_FROM=...
```
 
Calls are placed through Twilio reading the requirement script. A Twilio-formatted reply (`From`/`Body`) posted to `POST /api/webhooks/inbound` is parsed into a quote.
 
> The payload builders and inbound parser are unit tested; the calls themselves need real accounts and have not been exercised against live providers from this machine.

## 🧪 Tests
 
```bash
npm run typecheck              # server and client
npm test                       # 45 unit tests: matching, parser, aggregation, rate card, db, auth, channels
python scripts/smoke_test.py   # 68 end-to-end checks against a running server
```
 
---
 
## 🚢 Deployment
 
The build is `web/dist` (static), served by the single Node process:
 
```bash
npm run build
PORT=4000 DB_PATH=/var/lib/freightdesk/freightdesk.db WEBHOOK_TOKEN=... npm start
```
 
- 💾 **Back up** by copying the SQLite file (WAL mode — safe to copy while the process is running via `sqlite3 .backup`, or stop the process first)
- 🛑 Termination signals persist the working set before exit
- 🐳 No Dockerfile included — the process needs **Node 22+** and no other system dependencies
---
 
## ⚠️ Known Limitations
 
- 📞 Voice replies via webhook carry transcribed text only — a live voice conversation (barge-in, DTMF) is out of scope for this MVP
- 🗄️ The store is a single SQLite file: one process, no clustering — move to PostgreSQL before running multiple instances
- 🔐 Lock-in acceptance is simulated even in live mode — it needs a real vendor confirmation flow (reply keyword or operator action) before going live
