            FreightDesk is a working proof of concept for freight brokerage in South India. It matches transporters
            against your vendor master, sends an AI voice call and a Tamil WhatsApp message asking for their rate,
            parses the replies, suggests the lowest rate to your sales agent, then carries the job through trip,
            invoice and payment in the same record.

            confidence score. Replies under 0.80 confidence, or more than 30% away from the rate card reference, are
